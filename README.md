Course assignment using Java to process cars of voters and record their actions. Each voter is assigned a number and put in a queue. To simulate the data a csv file is provided to read in cars and voters. 

In VotingQueue.java all voters are processed from the csv file and a txt report is generated with the current date and time, the number of voters, the time that they took to vote, and some averages.

In votingQueue2.java cars are simulated with user input in the terminal and are processed as they come in. A similar report is generated when the user chooses to terminate the program.

This project was meant to emphasize the use of OOP, generic data types in Java, and using the data structure of queues.
